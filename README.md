### Vanilla `JavaScript` calculator 

- The idea behind this project is to work with `SCSS` and manipulate the DOM directly though JS code not using any Framework in particular.

- The calculator supports basic math operations: sum, substract, multiply and divide.
- Users can also clear everything in the calculations field (**"C"**), clear the last line in the calculations field (**"CE"**), and delete last character in the last line (**"DEL"**).

- To 'start' the application just load the `index.html` file in a browser of your choice.
